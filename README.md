## How to use the G-CODE stylizer
Download the G-CODE.xml file.\
In Notepad++:
- Click 'Language'
- Go down to 'User Defined Language'
- Click 'Import' and navigate to the xml file.
- In the dropdown menu, select G-CODE
- Add your G-Code file extensions to the 'Ext.' field seperated by a space. 'nc mpf eia gcd txt cam' are already populated.
- Click 'Save As...'
- Give it a name like 'G-Code'

Your files should automatically revert to this color scheme. If not, you may have to go up to Language and navigate down and select G-Code(or whatever you called it)
